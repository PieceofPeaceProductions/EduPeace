  <h1>EduPeace</h1>
<p>Piece of Peace Productions is developing a new, advanced app that will educate you about gun violence and help increase the stability of peace and justice in the world.</p>
  <p><b>Our Goal</b>
    <br>
  The world is far from perfect, and although it will never be perfect, we can help make it a better place. There are 17 global goals, and we are starting by working toward goal # 16: Peace and Justice. We hope to provide an app that can educate many people about gun violence and help spread awareness about it.</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Release</b><br>
    The app is available on the web in a phone simulator via appetize.io. <br>
